# Django_chat_app
a simple chat app using Django
The required libraries can be found in requirements.txt but you will also need to have:
 * redis server 3.2.1 installed and running in its local directory using  <$ redis-server.exe redis.windows.conf>
 * docker with version suitable for your windows/linux version should be installed. Here, I've used Docker Toolbox 19.03.1 suitable for my    windows 8.1.
Note that the port number used here is not the default 6397 but 16397. Remember to check that a virtual machine is installed when installing docker and also remember to add anything you install to the PATH variable.

### P.S.
you might need to install Visual studio 14.0 for some of the packages to run
